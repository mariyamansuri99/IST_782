# Master's Portfolio - Data Science Projects

## Overview
The repository contains key projects completed during my **Master's in Applied Data Science** program. Each project showcases **data collection, analysis, machine learning models, and data-driven decision-making** techniques applied to real-world problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository consists of three sub-folders, each corresponding to a major project. Inside each project folder, you'll find:
- **Project Deliverables**: Code, reports, presentations, or datasets used.
- **README.md**: A document explaining the project, required software, and how to run the files.

### Sub-Folders:
1. `IST707_AppliedMachineLearning_Project/` - Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification.
2. `IST718_BigDataAnalytics_Project/` - Predictive Analytics for Supply Chain Optimization.
3. `IST722_DataWarehouse_Project/` - Anti-Money Laundering Data Warehouse Implementation.

## How to Navigate This Repository
- **To explore a specific project**, navigate into the corresponding folder and refer to the project-specific `README.md` for details on execution and setup.
- **To run code**, ensure you meet the software and dependency requirements listed in each project's documentation.

## Required Software
To run most projects, you need:
- **Python 3.2+** (for machine learning and data processing projects)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive execution)
- **SQL Database** (for data warehousing projects)
- **Apache Spark** (for big data analytics)
- **BI Tools (Tableau, Power BI)** (for data visualization)
