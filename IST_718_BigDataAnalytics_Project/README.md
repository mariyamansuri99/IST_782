# Efficient Supply Chain Management for HIV Health Commodities

## Project Overview
The project was done by me and my group for the clas IST 718 Big Data Anaytics, this project applies big data analytics and machine learning to optimize the supply chain for HIV health commodities. By leveraging PySpark, the analysis aims to do delivery delay prediction, identify infuencing factors and improve logistical efficiency. The dataset, sourced from the USAID Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Dataset, includes information on global shipments, costs, delivery timelines, and vendor details.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files:

### 1. Code
- **Description:** This folder includes all scripts related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Key Components:**
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, standardizing dates, class balancing)
  - Machine learning models for regression and classification
  - Feature importance analysis for cost and delay predictions

### 2. Presentation
- **Description:** A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project, including methodology, insights, and results.
- **Key Components:**
  - Introduction and project objectives
  - Data analysis and visualization
  - Machine learning model performance and findings
  - Actionable recommendations

### 3. Report
- **Description:** A detailed project report documenting the research, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- **Key Components:**
  - Background and problem statement
  - Data exploration insights
  - Model implementation details
  - Discussion on cost optimization and key cost drivers
  - Conclusions and future improvements

## Software Requirements
To run the code and review the analysis, the following software and libraries are required:

### Required Software
- **Python 3.2+** (Recommended for compatibility)
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** for big data processing
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional) for interactive exploration
- **PowerPoint or Google Slides** for viewing the presentation
- **PDF Reader** for reading the report

### Required Python Libraries
To install the required dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pyspark scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## How to Review the Files
1. **Code:**
   - Open the scripts in Jupyter Notebook or a code editor.
   - Run the preprocessing and EDA steps first.
   - Execute machine learning models and review the output.

2. **Presentation:**
   - Open the PowerPoint file in Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides.
   - Review the slides to understand the project findings at a high level.

3. **Report:**
   - Open the report using a PDF reader.
   - Read through the sections to understand the detailed methodology and results.
